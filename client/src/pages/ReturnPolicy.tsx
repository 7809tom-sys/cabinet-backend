            You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund or credit.
            We'll also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an
            incorrect or defective item, etc.). If you did not purchase your merchandise directly from us,
            you will need to contact the company you made your purchase with and they will file a claim on
            your behalf.

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              The customer must note on the Delivery Receipt that there are damages to the packages to

              deny your claim.

              For items with concealed damage (damage noticed after the items are opened) you will need to
              file a claim within 90 days of delivery. If you are going to return the items, this must be
              done within 90 days of receiving your order. If we do not receive the return within 90 days,
              you will be charged the full amount of the replacement order. If you do not open a claim
              within 90 days of receiving your order, Clark &amp; Son will deny your claim.

            <li>
              If a return is needed, you will receive an RMA form that will need to be attached to any
              return package. If the RMA document is not returned with the items, your order will not be
              received and you will not receive a credit for those items.

          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Clark &amp; Son — 5 Year Limited Warranty</h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Vendor warrants to the original consumer purchaser that cabinetry, door hinges, and drawer
            glides will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for
            a period of <strong className="text-foreground">five (5) years</strong> from purchase date
            (Proof of Purchase is required). This warranty is not transferable and only applicable to
            product used for residential purposes. Representatives of this cabinet line do not have the
            authority to change or enlarge this warranty.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, damage or defects caused by accidents,
            misuse, abuse, or lack of necessary maintenance; nor does it cover alteration, modification,
            improper installation, improper handling / storage, environmental conditions, nor any labor
            expenses.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Vendor, at our option, may elect to repair or replace with a functionally equivalent product
            any product covered by this warranty. Some replacement parts are subject to availability and
            may differ from original parts received. Return of defective product may be required for a
            replacement to be issued. Repair parts or replacement parts are at the expense of the vendor,
            but customer shall bear all other expenses. These expenses may include, but are not limited to,
            cost of removal and re-installation of product, labor expenses, etc.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Just as no two trees are alike, no two pieces of wood are alike. The variation in color and
            grain pattern in wood adds to its natural beauty and is not considered an imperfection.
            Environmental factors, including but not limited to artificial / natural light, moisture,
            cleaners, smoke, etc., may cause the darkening or mellowing of a cabinet over time. This is
            a natural process and can be expected. This warranty does not cover the natural aging or
            darkening / mellowing of wood color, the inherent growth characteristics of, or variation in
            wood.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Some cabinet lines feature a glazed finish that accentuates the door and drawer front profiles.
            This glaze is hand-applied over a stain or paint and may, due to the nature of application,
            consist of random drips, runs, etc. As glazing is a hand-applied process there will be
            variations in color and appearance from door to door and cabinet to cabinet. This is not
            considered a defect and is considered normal with hand-applied finishes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
            It is the nature of wood to expand and contract to varying degrees depending on climate
            conditions. As a result, cabinet lines with painted surfaces may show fractures in the paint
            at joints. This is normal and is not considered a defect.

            This warranty is valid only in the United States of America and is not transferable. All
            implied warranties are limited in duration to the shorter of the period provided by law or
            the period of this warranty. To the extent permitted by law, this warranty excludes special,

            of incidental or consequential damages or limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts,
            so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific
            legal rights; you may have other rights which vary from state to state.
