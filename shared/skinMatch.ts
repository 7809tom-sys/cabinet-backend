// ─── Skin / decorative end-panel matching ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Rule (from the showroom): a cabinet with an EXPOSED visible side needs a
// matching skin / end panel in the SAME door style so the exposed side reads as
// finished cabinetry instead of raw box. This is especially mandatory for
// Hickory lines (HS "Silva Shaker", RH "Sylvan Rust"), which ship unfinished on
// the exterior — every exposed side must order a Hickory skin.
//
// This module is PURE (no DB / React) so both the server (BOM resolver) and the
// client (Design Tool recommendation) can share one source of truth, and it is
// unit-tested in skinMatch.test.ts.
