// ─── Hickory unfinished-end skin auto-suggest engine ────────────────────────
// Business rule: Hickory cabinets ship with UNFINISHED exposed sides. Any cabinet
// end that is visible (not buried against a wall and not abutted by a neighboring
// cabinet) needs a matching Hickory finished-end "skin" panel so the run looks
// finished. We auto-suggest one skin per exposed end, as a SEPARATE line item at
// the same Hickory finish.
//
// IMPORTANT: the real skin SKU + pricing is PENDING catalog-book confirmation
// from the owner. Until confirmed, suggestions are emitted with a placeholder
// suggestCode and `pendingSku: true` so the UI can clearly flag them and the
// owner can drop in the real SKU later without reworking this logic.
//
// All math is in INCHES and pure/deterministic so it is unit-testable
// independently of the canvas and the database.
