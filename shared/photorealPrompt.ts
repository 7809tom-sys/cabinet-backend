/**
 * Pure builder for the AI Photoreal Preview prompt. Kept framework-free and
 * side-effect-free so it can be unit tested and shared between the server
 * mutation and any future preview surface.
 *
 * The goal is a CONSISTENT, professional interior-photography look across every
 * render: same lens, same lighting language, same staging discipline — while
 * the design-specific facts (room size, finish, door style, counter, hardware,
 * per-wall layout) drive what is actually shown.
 *
 * Fidelity is the priority: the render MUST match the layout the user actually
 * built (which walls carry cabinets, whether there is an island, which
 * appliances exist). The model is otherwise prone to inventing a generic
 * L-shaped-kitchen-with-island, so we describe the true geometry explicitly and
 * add negative constraints against fabricated runs / islands / appliances.
