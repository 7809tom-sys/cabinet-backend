/**
 * Regression for the two 3D defects reported from the saved "carbon frost
 * 12x16" kitchen (Oct 2026 screenshot):
 *  1. The ERB36 corner countertop rendered as a 36x36 square plug with no
 *     front overhang, projecting past the neighbouring 25.5-inch run slabs.
 *  2. The over-refrigerator bridge (WR3624 at 72" over a 70" fridge, top at
 *     the 96" ceiling) received no crown, so the neighbouring W-2442's return
 *     crown ran THROUGH the bridge body to the wall instead of stopping at it
 *     and continuing along the bridge top.
